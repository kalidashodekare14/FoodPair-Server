# FoodPair (backend Project)

## Description

This is the backend of the project, designed to provide a robust API and handle business logic. It is built using the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that enables server-side development with a non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, allowing for easy scalability and performance.
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: A middleware used to enable cross-origin requests, allowing the backend to interact with frontend applications hosted on different domains.
- **dotenv**: A module to load environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`, facilitating configuration management.

This stack ensures a scalable and efficient backend solution, capable of handling a variety of API requests and managing data effectively.
